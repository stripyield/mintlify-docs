### **Phases**

Strip evolves through four natural phases. Understanding where you are determines your optimal strategy.

**Phase 1: Coordination**

PT staking is the only way to earn STRIP during the first phase. Early stakers get two advantages: they accumulate the highest boost scores (more time to build), and they earn from the largest STRIP allocations. This phase sets the vault TVL and establishes who's aligned from the start, with boost scores carrying forward into Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Competition**

Emissions shift to PT/STRIP pool LPs in phase 2, deepening liquidity while emissions are still flowing strong. This is peak emission territory, where buybacks are ramping up but emissions still dominate. Everyone's competing for rewards through their boost multipliers. If you've built boost in Phase 1, you have an edge here.

**Phase 3: Crossover**

Buybacks start exceeding emissions as emissions decline fast and buybacks grow with TVL. The protocol goes net deflationary while still distributing rewards. This is where the model proves itself. Most protocols die when emissions stop, but Strip gets stronger.

**Phase 4: Scarcity Endgame**

Emissions near zero, buybacks dominant. STRIP becomes a scarce claim on perpetually growing yield, with late holders benefiting from all the compounding work done in earlier phases.

## Overview

| Phase        | Primary Activity           | System Effect                               |
| :----------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| Coordination | PT staking builds TVL      | Vault base and alignment established        |
| Competition  | LP provision for emissions | Liquidity deepens, boost determines winners |
| Crossover    | Holding through deflation  | Float shrinks, scarcity strengthens         |
| Scarcity     | Alignment maintenance      | Buybacks sustain value                      |

The system transitions from cooperation → competition → accumulation → scarcity. No governance needed. It just happens based on the emission curve.
