title: "Lockless Boost"

### **What It Does**

The Lockless Boost is Strip's reputation layer. It rewards users who stay aligned with the protocol over time, without requiring locks or vote-escrow mechanics. Your boost score determines how much of the STRIP emissions you receive. Stay aligned, earn more. Break alignment, reset to minimum.

### **How It Works**

Each user has a boost multiplier ranging from **5% to 100%**. Boost increases when you: Hold STRIP in your wallet, Provide liquidity in PT/STRIP pools, Single stake PT's (first 60 days only) and Do this consistently over time.

Your Boost resets to 5% instantly if: Your STRIP balance drops during active emission periods or you break alignment.

**Summary**

- Price changes don't affect your boost (IL accounted for)
- Only your actions matter (deposits, withdrawals, claims, compounding)
- Slow to build (weeks)
- Instant to lose
- Your boost carries over when transitioning from PT staking to LP positions.

Boost rewards patience and alignment, not just capital size. You can't buy your way to high boost. You have to earn it through consistent behavior.
