Strip transforms yield-bearing assets into two powerful primitives:

- **PT (Principal Token)** - Redeemable 1:1 for your original deposit
- **STRIP (Yield Token)** - A claim on perpetually growing system-wide yield

**The twist:** When you deposit, your yield doesn't just go to you anymore. Half of it compounds forever in the protocol, creating an exponentially growing yield base that buys STRIP from the market.

**What this means:** You trade your individual linear yield for a share of collective exponential yield.
