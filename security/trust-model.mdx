**User deposits**: Users retain full control of their deposits. Only the depositor can withdraw by redeeming their PT shares. No admin function exists to move, withdraw, or redirect vault funds.

**Yield stripping**: The 50/49/1 split is hardcoded.

**STRIP emissions**: Emissions are allocated to staking pools based on vault performance (TVL × APR), weight calculated offchain. Claiming is permissionless and tokens are minted directly to users when they claim.

**Boost multipliers**: Boost multipliers are updated offchain and published as merkle roots. The multiplier range (0.05x to 1x) is hardcoded.

**Emergency functions**: Deposits can be paused during oracle failures. When paused, withdrawals use pro-rata calculation.

### Immutable Parameters

- Vault interactions
- Yield split ratios, boost bounds, reward duration, token economics
- Minting (EmissionsController validates all mint requests against allocated rewards)
- Safety checks (HWM resets bounded to ±1% of oracle, rate tolerance capped at 1%)
- Contract code (no proxies, no upgrade paths)

### Operational Parameters

**Emissions**

- `setRewardRate()` - Adjust STRIP emissions per second
- `addPool()` - Register new staking pools
- `setAllocPoint()` - Update pool allocation weights (TVL × APR is calculated offchain, then applied here)
- `setPoolEnabled()` - Enable or disable pools

**Oracle Parameters**

- `setMinRate()` - Set minimum acceptable oracle rate
- `setMaxRateDropBps()` - Adjust rate drop tolerance (capped at 1%)
- `resetHighWaterMark()` - Reset HWM within ±1% of current oracle rate

**Boost**

- `setMerkleRoot()` - Publish new boost multiplier merkle roots

**Emergency**

- `pause()` / `unpause()` - Enable emergency mode during oracle failures
