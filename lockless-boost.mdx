title: "Lockless Boost"

### **What It Does**

The Lockless Boost is Strip's reputation layer. It rewards users who stay aligned with the protocol over time, without requiring locks or vote-escrow mechanics.

Your boost score determines how much of the STRIP emissions you receive. Stay aligned, earn more. Break alignment, reset to minimum.

### **How It Works**

Each user has a boost multiplier ranging from **5% to 100%**.

**Boost increases when you:**

- Hold STRIP in your wallet
- Provide liquidity in PT/STRIP pools
- Stake PT (first 90 days only)
- Do this consistently over time

**Boost resets to 5% instantly if:**

- Your STRIP balance drops during active emission periods
- You break alignment

**Key rules:**

- Price changes don't affect your boost (normal market movement ignored)
- Only your actions matter (deposits, withdrawals, claims)
- Slow to build (weeks to months)
- Instant to lose
- Your boost carries over when transitioning from PT staking to LP positions at day 90

Boost rewards patience and alignment, not just capital size. You can't buy your way to high boost. You have to earn it through consistent behavior.
