1. **Deposit** your yield-bearing tokens, receive **PT** equal to the dollar value deposited
2. **Stake your PT** or **provide liquidity** in the PT/STRIP pool to earn STRIP
3. The vault **harvests yield** and splits it:
   - **50% Growth** - Stays in the vault, makes it bigger
   - **49% Buybacks** - Used to buy STRIP from the market
   - **1% Protocol Fee** - Covers operations, also used for STRIP buybacks
