title: "Lockless Boost"

### **What It Does**

The Lockless Boost is Strip's reputation layer. It rewards users who stay aligned with the protocol over time, without requiring locks or vote-escrow mechanics.

Your boost score determines how much of the STRIP emissions you receive. Stay aligned, earn more. Break alignment, reset to minimum.

### **How It Works**

Each user has a boost multiplier ranging from **5% to 100%**.

**Boost increases when you:**

- Hold STRIP in your wallet
- Provide liquidity in PT/STRIP pools
- Stake PT (first 30 days only)
- Do this consistently over time

**Boost resets to 5% instantly if:**

- You sell STRIP during active emission periods
- You withdraw from LP positions during active emissions
- You break alignment

**Key rules:**

- Price changes don't affect your boost (normal market movement ignored)
- Only your actions matter (deposits, withdrawals, claims)
- Slow to build (weeks to months)
- Instant to lose
- **Your boost carries over when transitioning from PT staking to LP positions at day 30**

### **Why This Matters**

A user with 100% boost earns 20x more STRIP than a user with 5% boost, even with the same capital.

Boost rewards patience and alignment, not just capital size. You can't buy your way to high boost. You have to earn it through consistent behavior.

**The insight:** Strip values long-term participants over short-term farmers.
