### **Introduction**

Strip lets you split yield-earning tokens into two separate pieces:

**PT (Principal Token)** - Redeemable 1:1 for the principal value deposited, excluding any accrued yield

**STRIP (Yield Token)** - Your share of all yield generated across the entire system.

When you deposit, your yield is split. Half stays in the protocol forever and compounds, creating a growing pool that generates more yield over time. The other half is used to buy & burn STRIP from the market. PT redemptions reflect principal value only, regardless of how much yield the underlying asset has generated over time.\
\
In simple terms: You trade your individual yield for a share of everyone’s combined, growing yield. STRIP emissions start by going to PT stakers (first 60 days), then shift to PT/STRIP liquidity providers. Early depositors get the best deal: more STRIP per dollar and more time for compounding to work.

Strip is perpetual, has no expiry dates and has one token: STRIP, the sole yield sink.
