### PT – Principal Token (e.g. PTsUSDe)

PT represents the principal value of a deposit.

- Redeemable 1:1 for deposit notional
- Serves as the stable leg in PT/STRIP pools
- Composable for external integrations
- Vault-specific by design

### STRIP – Yield Token

STRIP represents perpetual exposure to system-wide yield.

- Fixed supply of **1,000,000,000 STRIP**
  - **900,000,000** allocated to emissions (exponential decay)
  - **100,000,000** allocated to team and investors
- Freely tradable and usable in liquidity pools
- Backed by recurring buybacks funded by realized yield

As emissions decay, STRIP’s value shifts from issuance toward buybacks. In steady state, STRIP represents a shrinking claim on a growing yield base.

### STRIP Vesting Schedules

- **Team**: 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 36 months
- **Investors**: 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 24 months

All vesting is enforced on-chain via time-locked contracts.
