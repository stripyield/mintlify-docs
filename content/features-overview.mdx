### **1. Perpetual Yield Stripping**

Transforms yield-bearing collateral into two composable assets:

- **PT (Principal Token)** - Redeemable for dollar value deposited
- **STRIP (Yield Token)** - Perpetual claim on system-wide yield

No expiry dates. Yield flows perpetually. STRIP becomes the universal yield token across all vaults, forming a unified claim on system-wide yield.

### **2. Continuous Yield Routing**

Every vault's yield is split into three flows:

- **89% Growth** - Compounds vault principal, expands future yield capacity
- **10% Buyback** - Buys STRIP from the market, anchors price to yield fundamentals
- **1% Protocol Fee** - Covers operations

Strip follows a 1/10 structure — analogous to TradFi's 2/20 fund model, but inverted in the depositor's favor. Instead of paying a manager, the performance allocation accrues to STRIP holders perpetually, on a compounding base.

These flows form a reflexive loop: growth leads to buybacks, buybacks create scarcity, scarcity drives value, value attracts deposits, deposits create more yield.

### **3. Exponential Decay Emissions**

Emissions start high and decline smoothly over time. The curve is predictable and deterministic.

First 30 days: emissions go to PT stakers (coordination phase).

After 30 days: emissions shift permanently to PT/STRIP LPs (competition phase).

### **4. Merit-Based Emission Routing**

Different vaults produce different yields. Emissions route based on **APR × TVL** so each pool receives rewards proportional to its productivity.

This keeps incentives aligned and prevents unproductive capital from extracting value.

### **5. Lockless Boost**

A reputation system that rewards consistent alignment without requiring locked capital. Boost rises slowly while users stay aligned and resets instantly if they break alignment.

Market price changes are ignored. Only user actions matter. Alignment replaces lockups.

### **6. STRIP as Universal Yield Sink**

STRIP is the universal yield token across all vaults. All protocol yield flows converge into STRIP through continuous buybacks. Its value reflects total network yield and activity, making STRIP a self-indexing asset where system growth directly increases scarcity.
