### **STRIP - Yield Token**

- Perpetual exposure to system-wide yield
- Demand driven by continuous buybacks from every vault and protocol fees
- Market-tradable and LP-able in PT/STRIP pools

### **PT - Principal Token**

- Redeemable 1:1 notional (the dollar value of deposit, not underlying token amount)
- Serves as the stable asset in PT/STRIP pools
- Composable for external integrations
- Vault-specific (PTsUSDe, PTsUSDs, etc.)

### **STRIP Supply**

- **Emissions:** 90% (900M STRIP, exponential decay)
- **Team & Investors:** 10% (100M STRIP)

### **STRIP Vesting Schedules**

- **Team** - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 36 months (fully vested at month 48)
- **Investors** - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 24 months (fully vested at month 36)
