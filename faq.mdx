### **What is Strip in one sentence?**

A protocol that splits deposits into PT (principal) and STRIP (yield) and routes realized yield to compounding and perpetual STRIP buybacks.

### **Do I lose yield when I deposit?**

You exchange individual yield for STRIP. Your outcome depends on vault performance, STRIP market dynamics, and your alignment status under the Lockless Boost.

### **Can I lose principal?**

Protocol mechanics do not impair PT redemption, but principal is exposed to the underlying asset's risk (e.g., sUSDe depeg, stETH slashing).

### **Is STRIP inflationary?**

Emissions decline to near zero over time. Meanwhile, buybacks persist and remove STRIP from circulation. The system transitions from inflationary to deflationary.

### **How are emissions routed?**

Emissions go to PT stakers (Phase 1) or PT/STRIP liquidity providers (Phase 2). Allocation across vaults is based on **APR × TVL **to reward productive capital.

### **What is the Lockless Boost?**

A behavior-based modifier. Aligned users climb from 5% toward 100% boost. Breaking alignment during emissions resets to 5%.

### **Why give up my yield?**

You're trading individual linear yield for a share of collective exponential yield. If the system grows and your STRIP appreciates beyond what you would have earned individually, you win.
