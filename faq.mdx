**What is Strip in one sentence?**\
A protocol that splits deposits into principal and yield, then routes realized yield into compounding and perpetual STRIP buybacks.

**Do I lose yield when I deposit?**\
You exchange individual yield for STRIP exposure. Outcomes depend on system growth, STRIP pricing, and alignment.

**Can I lose principal?**\
PT redemption is preserved, but principal remains exposed to underlying asset risk.

**Is STRIP inflationary?**\
Emissions decay toward zero while buybacks persist, transitioning the system from inflationary to deflationary.

**How are emissions routed?**\
By APR × TVL, rewarding productive capital.

**Why give up my yield?**\
You trade linear individual yield for a share of collective, compounding yield. If STRIP appreciates beyond what you would have earned individually, the trade is favorable.
