### Growth

Strip does not rely on external incentives. System growth is driven by a closed compounding loop.

Vaults generate yield. 89% of that yield compounds, expanding the base that produces future yield. 10% removes STRIP from circulation through market buybacks. A larger base produces more yield in subsequent cycles, increasing both compounding and buybacks.

As TVL grows, yield grows. As yield grows, buybacks grow. As buybacks grow, STRIP supply contracts. Scarcity increases value, value attracts deposits, and deposits expand the base further. Each cycle reinforces the next.

### Lifecycle

The system progresses through distinct stages as emissions decay and buybacks increase.

- **Early phase**: emissions dominate and incentivize coordination and TVL formation
- **Mid phase**: compounding and buybacks begin to rival emissions in value
- **Late phase**: emissions approach zero while buybacks dominate system flows

This transition occurs automatically without governance or parameter changes.

### Benefits

Most incentive-driven protocols decay once emissions end. Strip does not. Even with zero growth, the existing base continues to generate yield, compound, and buy back STRIP. Growth amplifies outcomes, but sustainability does not depend on it.
