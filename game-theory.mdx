### Lifecycle

Strip evolves through four stages that define participant incentives.

**Phase 1: Coordination**\
PT staking is the sole emission path. Early participants earn the largest allocations and have the longest window to build boost. This phase establishes initial TVL and alignment.

**Phase 2: Competition**\
Emissions move to PT/STRIP liquidity providers. Liquidity deepens while emissions remain significant. Boost advantage becomes decisive.

**Phase 3: Crossover**\
Buybacks exceed emissions. The system becomes net deflationary while still distributing rewards, demonstrating sustainability beyond incentives.

**Phase 4: Scarcity**\
Emissions approach zero. Buybacks dominate. STRIP becomes a scarce claim on a perpetually compounding yield base.
