### **STRIP - Yield Token**

- Perpetual exposure to system-wide yield
- Demand driven by continuous buybacks from every vault and protocol fees
- Market-tradable and LP-able in PT/STRIP pools
- No governance rights (protocol is immutable)

### **PT - Principal Token**

- Redeemable 1:1 for dollar value of vault collateral deposited
- Serves as the stable asset in PT/STRIP pools
- Composable for external integrations
- Vault-specific (sUSDe-PT, stETH-PT, etc.)

### **Supply at Genesis**

- **Emissions:** 90% (900M STRIP, exponential decay)
- **Team & Investors:** 10% (100M STRIP)

### **Vesting Schedules**

- **Team** - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 36 months (fully vested at month 48)
- **Investors** - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 24 months (fully vested at month 36)
