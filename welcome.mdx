### **Introduction**

Strip is a protocol for separating principal from yield and routing that yield into a single, compounding system.

When a yield-bearing asset is deposited, it is split into two components:\
\
A depositor receives **PT (Principal Tokens)**, redeemable 1:1 for the notional value of the deposit, excluding yield. \
\
**Yield** exposure is represented by **STRIP**, which reflects a claim on all yield generated across the protocol.

Realized yield is not returned to individual depositors. Instead, it is processed at the protocol level. The vast majority of yield remains in the system permanently and compounds, expanding the productive base. A portion is used to buy and burn STRIP from the market, anchoring STRIP's value to the yield the system generates. PT redemptions always return principal only, independent of the yield generated by the underlying asset.

Strip follows a 1/10 structure — 1% protocol fee, 10% of yield to STRIP buybacks. Analogous to TradFi's 2/20 fund model, but inverted: instead of paying a manager, the performance allocation accrues to STRIP holders perpetually, on a compounding base that grows every cycle.

In effect, depositors exchange individual, linear yield for exposure to collective, compounding yield. STRIP emissions initially reward PT stakers during the coordination phase, then shift to PT/STRIP liquidity providers. Early participants benefit from higher emissions per dollar and more time for compounding to accumulate.

Strip is perpetual. There are no expiries, rollovers, or terminal states. All yield ultimately converges into a single yield sink: STRIP.
