### **What Strip Does**

Strip lets you split yield-earning tokens into two separate pieces:

- **PT (Principal Token)** - Redeemable 1:1 for the dollar value you deposited. Your principal is always accessible.
- **STRIP (Yield Token)** - Your share of all yield generated across the entire system.

Here’s what makes it different: When you deposit, the vast majority of your yield stays in the protocol forever and compounds. This creates a growing pool that generates more and more yield over time. A portion of that growing yield is used to buy STRIP from the market, anchoring its value to real protocol productivity. \
\
Strip runs a 1/10 structure: 1% protocol fee, 10% of yield to STRIP buybacks. Think of it like TradFi’s 2/20 fund model — except instead of paying a manager, the performance allocation goes to STRIP holders, forever, on a compounding base. In simple terms: you trade your individual yield for a share of everyone’s combined, growing yield. STRIP emissions start by going to PT stakers (first 30 days), then shift to PT/STRIP liquidity providers.

Early depositors get the best deal: more STRIP per dollar and more time for compounding to work.

**Strip is perpetual. No expiry dates, no fragmented markets, one STRIP token across all vaults.**
