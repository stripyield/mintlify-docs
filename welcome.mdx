### **Introduction**

Strip is a protocol for separating principal from yield and routing that yield into a single, compounding system.

When a yield-bearing asset is deposited, it is split into two components:\
\
A depositor receives **PT (Principal Tokens)**, redeemable 1:1 for the notional value of the deposit, excluding yield. \
\
**Yield **exposure is represented by **STRIP**, which reflects a claim on all yield generated across the protocol.

Realized yield is not returned to individual depositors. Instead, it is processed at the protocol level. Half of the yield remains in the system permanently and compounds, expanding the productive base. The other half is used to buy and burn STRIP from the market. PT redemptions always return principal only, independent of the yield generated by the underlying asset.

In effect, depositors exchange individual, linear yield for exposure to collective, compounding yield. STRIP emissions initially reward PT stakers during the coordination phase, then shift to PT/STRIP liquidity providers. Early participants benefit from higher emissions per dollar and more time for compounding to accumulate.

Strip is perpetual. There are no expiries, rollovers, or terminal states. All yield ultimately converges into a single yield sink: STRIP.
