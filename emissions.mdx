### Emission Split

Emissions are allocated across vaults based on **APR × TVL**. Vaults that generate more yield for the system receive a larger share of emissions, aligning incentives with productivity.

### Emission Distribution

- **Phase 1**: emissions are directed to PT single stakers
- **Phase 2**: emissions shift to PT/STRIP liquidity providers

### Emission Schedule

STRIP emissions follow a deterministic exponential decay:

- **E(t) = E₀ × exp(−λ × t)**
- Initial rate (**E₀**): 900,000 STRIP per day
- Decay constant (**λ**): 0.001 per day

The schedule is transparent, predictable, and immutable.
