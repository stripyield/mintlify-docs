How It WorksStrip uses **StripVaults** to manage deposits. Each vault accepts a yield-bearing asset (like sUSDe), gives you **PT** tokens, and handles the yield split. Every vault has its own **PT/STRIP pool** weighted 92/8.\
\
What Happens When You Deposit\
\
1.**Deposit** your yield-bearing tokens, receive **PT** equal to the dollar value deposited

2. **Stake your PT** or **provide liquidity** in the PT/STRIP pool to earn STRIP
3. The vault **harvests yield** and splits it:
   - **50% Growth** - Stays in the vault, makes it bigger
   - **49% Buybacks** - Used to buy STRIP from the market
   - **1% Protocol Fee** - Covers operations, also used for STRIP buybacks

### **The Key Parts**

- **StripVault** - Holds your deposits and manages yield.
- **PT/STRIP Pool (92/8)** - Where PT and STRIP trade. Heavily weighted to PT for stability.
- **Emission Routing** - STRIP rewards go to pools based on **APR × TVL** across vaults. More productive vaults get more emissions.
- **Lockless Boost** - Rewards users who stay aligned with the protocol over time.
