### **The Four Phases**

Strip evolves through four natural phases. Understanding where you are determines your optimal strategy.

### **Phase 1: Coordination **

**What's happening:** Building the foundation.

**Emissions go to:** PT stakers only.

**Your move:** Stake PT to earn STRIP and build boost score.

**Why it matters:** Early stakers accumulate the highest boost scores and largest STRIP allocations. This phase establishes vault TVL and initial alignment.

### **Phase 2: Competition **

**What's happening:** Liquidity deepens, emissions still flowing strong.

**Emissions go to:** PT/STRIP pool LPs.

**Your move:** Migrate to LP positions to keep earning.

**Why it matters:** Highest absolute emissions happen here. Buybacks are ramping up but emissions still dominate. Users compete for rewards through boost scores.

### **Phase 3: Crossover **

**What's happening:** Buybacks start exceeding emissions.

**Emissions:** Declining rapidly.

**Buybacks:** Growing with TVL.

**Your move:** Hold STRIP and maintain alignment for remaining emissions.

**Why it matters:** This is when the model proves itself. The protocol becomes net deflationary while still distributing rewards.

### **Phase 4: Scarcity Endgame **

**What's happening:** Emissions near zero, buybacks dominant.

**Emissions:** ~10% of peak.

**Buybacks:** 90%+ of value flow.

**Your move:** Hold STRIP for scarcity value.

**Why it matters:** Late holders benefit from all the early compounding work. STRIP becomes a scarce claim on perpetually growing yield.

### **The Incentive Shift**

| Phase        | User Focus                  | System Effect                              |
| :----------- | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| Coordination | Stake PT to build TVL       | Establishes vault base and alignment       |
| Competition  | Provide LP and stay aligned | Deepens liquidity and market participation |
| Crossover    | Hold and accumulate STRIP   | Reduces float and strengthens scarcity     |
| Scarcity     | Maintain alignment          | Sustain value through buybacks             |

The system naturally transitions from cooperation to competition to accumulation to scarcity.
