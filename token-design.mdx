### **PT - Principal Token  (i.e. PTsUSDe)**

- Redeemable 1:1 notional (the dollar value of deposit)
- Serves as the stable asset in PT/STRIP pools (i.e. PTsUSDe/STRIP)
- Composable for external integrations
- Vault-specific (PTsUSDe, PTsUSDs, etc.)

### **STRIP - Yield Token**

- Perpetual exposure to system-wide yield
- Demand driven by continuous buybacks from every vault and protocol fees
- Market-tradable and LP-able in PT/STRIP pools

### **STRIP Supply**

- 1 Billion total max supply
- Emissions: **90%** (900M STRIP, exponential decay)
- Team & Investors: **10%** (100M STRIP)

### **STRIP Vesting Schedules**

- Team - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 36 months (fully vested at month 48)
- Investors - 12-month cliff, linear vesting over 24 months (fully vested at month 36)
