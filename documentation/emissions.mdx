### **The Emission Curve**

STRIP emissions follow an exponential decay, starting high and declining smoothly over time.

**Formula:**

- Daily emission rate: `E(t) = E₀ × exp(−λ × t)`
- Where: `E₀ = 900,000 STRIP per day` (initial rate)
- And: `λ = 0.001 per day` (decay constant)

**What this means:**

- Day 1: 900,000 STRIP per day
- Year 1: ~750,000 STRIP per day average
- Year 3: ~200,000 STRIP per day average
- Year 5: ~50,000 STRIP per day average
- Total lifetime emissions: **900M STRIP**

By year 5.5, 86.5% of all STRIP will have been distributed. The rest streams out gradually as a long tail.

### **Where Emissions Go**

**Phase 1 (Day 0-90):** All emissions go to PT stakers.

**Phase 2 (Day 90+):** All emissions go to PT/STRIP pool liquidity providers.

### **How Emissions Are Split Across Vaults**

Emissions are allocated to pools based on **APR × TVL**. More productive vaults get more emissions.

**Example:**

- Vault A: \$10M TVL at 20% APR = \$2M productivity score
- Vault B: \$20M TVL at 5% APR = \$1M productivity score
- Result: Vault A gets 67% of emissions, Vault B gets 33%

This keeps incentives aligned with value generation. Vaults that produce more yield for the system earn more rewards.
