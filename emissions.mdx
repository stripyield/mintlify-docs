### **Emission Curve**

STRIP emissions follow an exponential decay, starting high and declining smoothly over time.

**Formula:**

- Daily emission rate: `E(t) = E₀ × exp(−λ × t)`
- Where: `E₀ = 900,000 STRIP per day` (initial rate)
- And: `λ = 0.001 per day` (decay constant)

### **Emission Recipients**

**Phase 1 (Day 0-90):** All emissions go to PT stakers.

**Phase 2 (Day 90+):** All emissions go to PT/STRIP pool liquidity providers.

### **Emission Split**

Emissions are allocated to pools based on **APR × TVL**. More productive vaults get more emissions. This keeps incentives aligned with value generation. Vaults that produce more yield for the system earn more rewards.
